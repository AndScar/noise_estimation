# noise_estimation
The repository contains a MATLAB code for dynamical noise estimation with some examples.

In Noise_estimation_example.m there are some examples of noisy series generation and of their noise level estimation.

P_M.m generates noisy series from Pomeau-Manneville maps. 

Logistic_dyn.m generates noisy series from Logistic maps.

Raw_noise_evaluation.m performs a first raw noise estimation of a noisy series.

Noise_evaluation_fit.m returns a more accurate noise estimation, starting from the raw one.

More details about the code usage can be found within each paper.
